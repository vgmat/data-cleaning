Getting and Cleaning Data Week 4 Project og Dr. V.GNANARAJ
This is a Repository for Coursera's "Getting and Cleaning Data" Week 4 project. Contains R code, codebook, and tidy data set for the assignment.

Files:
CodeBook.md describes  all variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R accommodate all the code to perform the analyses explained in the 5 tasks. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file. Here are the five tasks:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

tidyData.txt is the output of the final step
